1. Usage
This file is intended to explain the main components
of the system and how to use it.

2. Main components
    a. broker.py
        This file contains the broker
    b. client.py
        This file contains the client
    c. db_utils.py
        This file contains the interface
        allowing the client to connect to its
        local record (an SQLite database).
    d. constants.py
        This file contains necessary constants
        for running the entire system.
    (Everything else is miscellany for testing purposes)

3. How to run
    a. Install dependencies
        - python 2.7.*
        - pip (python package)
        - watchdog (python package)
        - twisted (python package)
    b. Start a broker: run 'python broker.py'
        - This will start a broker on port 55555.
          If this port will not work for you,
          change PORT in constants.py
    c. Start clients: run 'python client.py -d (workspace directory)'
        - There are several command line arguments
          that could be helpful..
          -h --host     : broker host to connect to, default is localhost
          -p --port     : broker port to connect to, default is 55555
          -r --record   : record source to connect to
          -d --dir      : local workspace directory
          -v --verbose  : verbosity level
    d. Make changes to any workspace directory, and watch the magic happen!
