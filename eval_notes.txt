Evaluation:

- timed sending files of size 2^0 MB -> 2^10 MB (truncate to desired scale)
  - on LAN with D-Sync
     - broker on different computer
     - clients on same computer since round trip is required (no short-cuts)
        - this means we can just compare time stamps of sending time to max/avg receiving time to know RTT
        - single broker bottleneck can be seen with jump at 1 GB file (could choose to ignore)
  - on LAN with Dropbox (not exactly LAN, as must send to server)
     - this could also probably be compared to WAN if we ignore LAN sync, which probably doesn't work on UO Secure
  - on WAN with D-Sync (network too wishy-washy for interesting results)


- Used random data to simulate encrypted non-deduplicatable files (could say actually send SHA, AED, RSA, etc. files if we wantedâ€¦)

- Made some pretty graphs

- Timed bringing user online to given directory sizes

  - no matter how many clients in group, takes about the same amount of time (similar to 2 client online graph) (ROWA)
