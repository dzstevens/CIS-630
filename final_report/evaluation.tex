\section{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}
We evaluated our system with respect to performance and correctness.
For the former, we measure the latency of key synchronization tasks
across different network scenarios and compare the results
with Dropbox. For the latter, we test specific use cases
where synchronization could fail and demonstrate that the system
properly handles these cases.
