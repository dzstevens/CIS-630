\section{Project Idea}
\subsection{Scope/Topic} 
We look into [file hosting services (Dropbox) | revision systems (Github)], which is a popular system for [ collaborative work, remote file storage, FILL IN ].
\subsection{Problem} 
These services/systems work well with centralized storage, but keeping all data at a central server or group of servers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increases risk of privacy issues
\item Central point of failure
\end{enumerate}
[FILL IN more from SOUP and elsewhere]
\subsection{Solution}
Distribute data storage for these [file hosting services | revision systems] across all users, by storing replicas on individual user machines.

-Punt on security: SHA and PKI and everything else those schizoid nerds have come up with
\subsection{Questions}
(Given that nodes do not know global state----and are dealing with a dynamic distributed system--nodes may come and go, nodes may crash, multiple users may work on the same data)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Timing/Synchronicity:

-How do we handle distributed updates of replicas, or rather how do we synchronize updates?

-How do we synchronize updates

\item Availability vs Network Overhead:

-How do we handle node failures?  How do we update data when a node returns?

-How do we ensure that a node gets updated/current data?

\item Group membership:

-How do we keep track of which nodes have replicas?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
(synchronicity/replication strategies--conservative or optimistic--in DS, issues with DropBox, open source revision|file hosting)
(FILL IN)

\section{Design}
Readers and Writers
Messages:
-Write (create, push update)
-Read (pull update)
-Join (group, project|revision ?)
Version numbers?
Synch strategy:
-conservative or optimistic?
\section{Evaluation}
Compare to [ DropBox | Github | other open source system ]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Testing Platform:
lossy network
\item Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Types of users:

-lenient (just want a more current copy of the data)

-strict (want most up-to-date copy of the data)
\item Environment:

-unstable (significant node dynamics)

-stable
\end{itemize}
\item Metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Available:

-network overhead?

-failed pull attempts?
\item Reliable:

-number of successful up-to-date pulls?
\end{itemize}
\item Scalability:
\end{enumerate}
\section{Timeline}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This weekend: complete literature review (synchronicity/replication strategies in DS, issues with DropBox, open source revision|file hosting)

-Each of us: research 1 of each

-Fill in 1 paragraph summary of any literature, add any ideas to notes

\item Week 8: Design
\item Week 9 (Thanksgiving): Testing/Evaluation
\item Week 10: Presentation, Write paper
\item Final Exam Week: Write paper, turn in paper, have multiple celebratory beers
\end{enumerate}
