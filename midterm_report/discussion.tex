%lessons learned? (improvements, ideas for next time)
%self-evaluation? (grade performance so far w/ justification)
In our work thus far, we have arrived at some helpful takeaways for future work.
For one, we note that many issues have arisen from inconsistencies in NELL's knowledge base.
It is clear that in conducting research, one must not assume perfect correctness in the data sources used,
and one must be able to handle to inconsistencies in such sources as they arise.
Following this caveat, we also find that it is important to thoroughly examine your data sources
as we have done.

In evaluating our work at its halfway point, we conservatively give ourselves a grade of A-.
We have completed milestones in accordance with our timeline,
and have successfully accomplished our base step of running the inference algorithm
on our corrected dataset on a single machine.
With this work behind us, we are well staged to begin parallelizing our solution
and testing it on the ACIS grid.
Moreover, we have learned a considerable amount of information about GraphLab,
one of the more capable distributed machine learning frameworks available today.
In leveraging this work toward extracting structured knowledge from the Internet,
we contribute to a valuable task involving the most influential distributed system of our time.
