%plan for the remainder of the term
  %\begin{itemize}
  %\item \bf Week ~3 -- 4  \rm~Literature review and familiarization with GraphLab
  %\item \bf Weeks 5 -- 7  \rm~Design and implementation
  %\item \bf Weeks 8 -- 9  \rm~Experimentation and evaluation
  %\item \bf Week ~10~~~ \rm~Paper and presentations
  %\end{itemize}
Having discussed what we have done in the first half of this project,
we now address our plan for the remainder of the term.
Our updated timeline is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Week 6} Address remaining issues with dataset inconsistencies, and begin porting our solution
  to run on the ACIS grid.
  \item \textbf{Week 7} Address any arising issues with parallelizing our solution, including how to properly partition the inference task.
  \item \textbf{Week 8} Define metrics for experiments, run experiments, collect data.
  \item \textbf{Week 9} Finish remaining experiment and data collection tasks, begin analyzing results.
  \item \textbf{Week 10} Formalize results and analysis, write paper, present research.
\end{itemize}
